#5City Casino Hack Minigame

An attempt to recreate as faithfully as possible the mini-game of breaking into the side rooms of the safe in the casino of the GTA WL-ON 5City server.
The minigame was created based on the currently only approach to this hack. This approach was made by Ewroon during the second casino robbery.

# Why didn't you create an array with symbols corresponding to their multipliers?
Because it's impossible.
The same symbol (e.g. "X") may have different multipliers during different hacking attempts.
e.g.
In one trial, the "X" symbol may have a multiplier of 10, while in another it may have a multiplier of 50.

# Description and guide
A hack can be solved with simple logical thinking. Below, however, I present the algorithm for solving the hack and its brief description.

### Conditions for a failed hack
1. Battery depletion - after a certain period of time (20s), the battery status drops to 0%,
2. Combining all available digits with inappropriate characters (then the result field is different from the target field).
